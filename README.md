# zscan-plugin-gitlab

## GitLab Job script for uploads to zScan

This script can be used to upload mobile applications to Zimperium (zScan) to be scanned for vulnerabilities. Using this script simplifies integrating mobile application security testing into CI/CD process and enables detection and remediation of vulnerabilities earlier in the application SDLC.

For more information on zScan, please see [Continuous Mobile Application Security Scanning](https://www.zimperium.com/zscan/).

## Prerequisites

1. Zimperium [MAPS](https://www.zimperium.com/mobile-app-protection/) license that includes zScan functionality.
2. API credentials with permissions to upload binaries
3. A valid application binary (.ipa, .apk, etc.), either built by the current pipeline or otherwise accessible by the script.

## Parameters

We recommend using GitLab [Variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui) to provide parameters to the script.  Select [Masked](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#mask-a-cicd-variable) or [Masked and hidden](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#hide-a-cicd-variable) under Visibility, as needed.  Please refer to the [GitLab Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) for other ways to supply parameters to the script.

### Mandatory

These parameters are mandatory, _unless_ a default value is available as described below. 

- **ZSCAN_SERVER_URL**: console base URL, e.g., `https://ziap.zimperium.com/`.
- **ZSCAN_CLIENT_ID** and **ZSCAN_CLIENT_SECRET**: API credentials that can be obtained from the console. 
- **ZSCAN_INPUT_FILE**: the path to the binary relative to the current workspace.
- **ZSCAN_TEAM_NAME**: name of the team to which this application belongs.  This is required only if submitting the application for the first time; values are ignored if the application already exists in the console and assigned to a team.  If not supplied, the application will be assigned to the 'Default' team
- **ZSCAN_REPORT_FORMAT**: the format of the scan report, either 'json' or 'sarif' (default).  If you plan on importing zScan results into GitLab Ultimate edition, please use sarif format.  For more information on the SARIF format, please see [OASIS Open](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html).

### Optional

These parameters are optional, but may be used to supply additional information about the build and/or control the plugin's output.

- **ZSCAN_REPORT_LOCATION**: destination folder for the vulnerability report. If not provided, the report is stored in the current workspace. Report location and name are important for [Job Artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/job_artifacts.html) collection.
- **ZSCAN_REPORT_FILE_NAME**: filename of the report. If not provided, the filename will be patterned as follows: zscan-results-AssessmentID-report_format.json, e.g., *zscan-results-123456789-sarif.json*.
- **ZSCAN_WAIT**: wait time for polling the server in seconds. 30 seconds is the default.
- **ZSCAN_BRANCH**: source code branch that the build is based on.
- **ZSCAN_BUILD_NUMBER**: application build number.
- **ZSCAN_ENVIRONMENT**: target environment, e.g., uat, dev, prod.

## Usage

Please refer to [GitLab Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/) for instructions on using scripts in your GitLab pipelines.  Here's a _sample_ zScan job that uploads an Android application to zScan and converts zScan SARIF output into GitLab's SAST-compatible artifact:

```JSON
# Upload to zScan and wait for scan results
zScan:
  needs: [assembleDebug]
  interruptible: true
  stage: test
  script:
    - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zimperium/zscan-plugin-gitlab/refs/heads/master/zScan_v1.sh
    - chmod +x zScan_v1.sh
    - ./zScan_v1.sh
    # Optional
    - wget -O sarif-converter https://gitlab.com/ignis-build/sarif-converter/-/releases/v0.9.2/downloads/bin/sarif-converter-linux-amd64
    - chmod +x sarif-converter
    - ./sarif-converter --type sast $PLUGIN_REPORT_FILE_NAME zscan-report.json
  artifacts:
    name: "zScan Results"
    reports:
      sast:
        - zscan-report.json
```

The above example assumes that the variables are correctly configured, including server URL, client id/secret, and the input file. The optional section uses an open source SARIF-to-GitLab converter to convert zScan report into the format suitable for importing into [GitLab Security dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/).  The Dashboard is only available with the GitLab Ultimate edition.  If this step is not applicable, you can modify the Artifact section of the job to look like this:

```JSON
  artifacts:
    name: "zScan Results"
    paths:
      $PLUGIN_REPORT_FILE_NAME
```
